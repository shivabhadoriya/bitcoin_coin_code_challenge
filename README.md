This assignment is the part of the summer of bitcoin code challenge, the required code challenge file can be found on the repository home page, I tried to solve the challenge within the time constraint,

I have included N files in the repository 

1. The first one is the Readme file which you are currently in, it gives you a basic idea about the challenge.
2. Second one is the summer of bitcoin code challenge file, which briefly describes the code challenge.
3. Third one is the mempool.csv file which is going to be imported into the code challenge.
4. Fourth one is the block.txt file which shows the output of the code challenge each separated by a new line as described in the code challenge.
5. The Fifth one is .ipynb file, which contains the code written in python by me to execute the code challenge, if it won't open on github, use the link

Thanks!
